# ProgGamesCoursework1
Project 1 for programming for games requirements 

- Implement a class Quadratic to store co-efficients of an instance of a polynomial of degree 2. Store
your components on the stack. 

- Write a class Polynomial which can cope with arbitrary
polynomials rather than just quadratics. This will require data to be stored on the heap rather than
the stack using a C++ array to store co-efficients.

STL vector class or variants based on other STL data structures. </b>
